## Composition approach

The project provides a “Groovebox” or graphical step-sequencer program with
algorithmic track generation abilities. After inputting a base melody and/or
song parameters, users can create and play back algorithmically-generated music
created from those inputs.

Since the program makes multiple algorithms available for use, there are
multiple points of interest in our approach. The available algorithms are:

- First-species counterpoint: the user inputs a base melody, and a second part
  is automatically generated with notes that follow the first-species rules.
- Serialism: The user selects the base note as the root of the tone row, and a
  part that follows the rules of Serialism is generated.
- TODO: Update this.
