## Composition approach

The project provides a “Groovebox” or graphical step-sequencer program that
uses higher order multidimensional cellular automata and neural networks to
produce a song. The algorithmic method is a hybrid approach that starts with the
user setting the on/off status of each "cell" in the step sequencer grid. This
is translated into the starting state of the Cellular Automata. The Automata is
run for a certain number of cycles (depending on the length of the song), then
that input is passed into a pre-trained neural network, which adds additional
harmony parts using a network. The output of the network is then translated into
Music21 data structures which can be played.
